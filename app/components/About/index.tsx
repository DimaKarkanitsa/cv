const About = () => (
  <p>
    While working as a UX/UI designer, I discovered my true passion lay in
    building interfaces rather than just designing them. I was drawn to the
    logic and interaction aspects, which led me to pursue a career as a frontend
    developer. Now, I thrive in the world of coding and creating user-friendly
    interfaces. I have expertise in building web applications using modern
    TypeScript and staying up-to-date with the latest frontend libraries and
    frameworks. Furthermore, my extensive experience in managing various
    projects has equipped me with the skills to excel as a team member and a
    leader when needed. I bring a collaborative spirit and the ability to lead
    and inspire teams, making me an asset in any project.
